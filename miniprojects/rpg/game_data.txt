			"description": "The cell is constructed from weathered stone, its walls worn by the marks of countless prisoners who have passed through its confines.",
			"details": "Dim torchlight flickers along the cold, damp walls, revealing the coarse texture of the bricks and the rusted iron bars that confine the cell. A narrow, straw-strewn cot occupies one corner, a meager comfort for those awaiting judgment. The air is thick with the scent of mildew and the distant echoes of clanking armor and muffled conversations from the bustling world outside. A heavy, iron door, adorned with a simple, worn latch, stands as the threshold between captivity and freedom. The only window, small and high, allows slivers of pale sunlight to filter through, offering a tantalizing glimpse of the outside world... a world from which you are temporarily severed.",

			"details": "The uneven flagstone floor echoes with the distant drip of water, creating a haunting rhythm that resonates through the subterranean passageway. Cobwebs drape from the corners, evidence of the passage of time undisturbed. The occasional rat scurries in the darkness, its tiny claws echoing through the eerie stillness. To the west you see an empty cell. To the east you see stairs.",

			"details": "An empty jail cell, a testament to the ebb and flow of justice in a realm where swords and sorcery shape destinies. A single, barred window allows the pale sunlight to filter through, casting a gentle glow on the cold, stone floor. Along the back wall you notice a stone that appears to be loose. Behind the stone you notice a tunnel.",

The air within is damp and cool, carrying the scent of earth and adventure. The uneven walls bear the marks of chipped away stone, evidence of the clandestine efforts to create this secret passageway.",

			"details": "A large, oak table dominates the center of the room, strewn with maps, parchments, and half-empty tankards. Wooden stools surround the table, bearing the marks of countless hours of vigilant watch. At the head of the table, a grizzled guard captain surveys the surroundings, a map of the dungeon spread out before them, tracing the paths of both prisoners and potential threats.",

A soft, ambient light spills through the opening, revealing a stark contrast to the dimly lit passages you leave behind. The air is fresh, carrying the scent of pine and earth, a welcome departure from the dungeon's stale atmosphere. To the west you see a guard room. To the south-west you see an escape tunnel",
